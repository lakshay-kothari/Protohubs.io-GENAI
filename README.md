# Protohubs.io-GENAI

A collection of hands-on mini-projects developed during an industry-led Generative AI & LLM Workshop. Each Jupyter Notebook explores core GenAI concepts including prompt engineering, NLP pipelines, fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, QLoRA), and applications using transformer models (GPT-3, ChatGLM, LLaMA 2). Projects span tasks like text classification, question answering, summarization, and conversational AI.

Note: All projects are yet to be completely deployable.
